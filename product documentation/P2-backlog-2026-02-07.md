# P2 Backlog - 2026-02-07

## Purpose
Track medium-priority improvements to execute only after P0/P1 closure.

## Prioritized P2 Items

### P2-1 Accessibility Baseline (WCAG 2.2 AA)
- Scope:
  - Add labels for icon-only controls.
  - Improve focus visibility and keyboard order in auth/onboarding modals.
  - Ensure color contrast on low-emphasis text and status chips.
- Deliverables:
  - Accessibility checklist with pass/fail by screen.
  - Updated component-level tests for keyboard navigation.

### P2-2 Trust and UX Clarity
- Scope:
  - Clarify payment status messaging (`payment processed` vs `subscription active`).
  - Remove unsupported quantified claims unless backed by data.
  - Improve empty/error states for AI-generated plan steps.
- Deliverables:
  - Updated copy in landing/pricing/onboarding.
  - UI state matrix for loading/empty/error/success.

### P2-3 Security Header Completion
- Scope:
  - Move CSP and security headers to hosting/edge config.
  - Add `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, and HSTS (prod).
  - Evaluate SRI usage for static third-party assets.
- Deliverables:
  - Deployment config updates.
  - Security checklist with header verification outputs.

### P2-4 AI Output Reliability
- Scope:
  - Add strict schema fallback for malformed AI responses.
  - Add provenance markers in AI output (source of assumptions).
  - Add retries/backoff only for safe idempotent AI calls.
- Deliverables:
  - AI contract tests for schema validation.
  - Error budget policy for model failures.

### P2-5 Performance and Bundle Health
- Scope:
  - Address Vite large-chunk warning via route/component splitting.
  - Reduce initial JS payload for landing/auth path.
- Deliverables:
  - Build report before/after.
  - Lazy-load strategy for non-critical views.

## Execution Order
1. Accessibility baseline
2. Trust/copy + checkout state clarity
3. AI schema resilience and contract tests
4. Security header completion
5. Bundle/perf optimization

## Done Criteria
- Primary user journey keyboard-accessible and screen-reader navigable.
- Critical user-facing claims map to shipped behavior.
- AI failures degrade gracefully with explicit user messaging.
- Hosting-level security headers verified in production response headers.
- Build output no longer ships oversized critical-path chunk by default.
