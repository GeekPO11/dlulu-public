# P2 Backlog (After P0/P1 Close)

## Product + UX
- Add persistent, user-visible billing status page event timeline (checkout initiated, intent confirmed, entitlement active).
- Add explicit free-plan limit hint near every "Start New Ambition" trigger before click.
- Add empty-state recovery CTA when onboarding progress is stale in `sessionStorage`.

## Engineering + Quality
- Add Playwright e2e flows:
  - Free user with one goal sees upgrade gate when adding second goal.
  - Successful checkout returns to add-goal onboarding context.
  - Blueprint nav controls do not trigger unintended publish state.
- Add CI job for `npm run check:pregolive` on protected branch.
- Add bundle splitting strategy for current large main chunk (`dist/assets/index-*.js` warning).

## Data Trust + Observability
- Add read-only admin SQL view for entitlement source resolution (`override` vs `subscription` vs `default`) per user.
- Add event-level telemetry for onboarding walkthrough drop-off by step id.
- Add dashboard panel for failed edge-function calls by route/function.
