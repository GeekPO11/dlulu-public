## "How Limits Work" (Microcopy)
> **Fairness First**: We don't charge usage fees. Free plans get a generous starter bucket of AI credits (approx 50 detailed chats). Pro plans get 20x that amount—enough for hours of daily planning. If you hit the limit, we never lock your data; we just slow things down a bit until next month.

## FAQ

**Q: Why pay when ChatGPT is free?**
A: ChatGPT is a chatbot that forgets you every session. dlulu is a stateful Life OS that tracks your progress, manages your schedule, and remembers your constraints forever. You're paying for the *system*, not just the text.

**Q: Is Calendar Sync included in Free?**
A: No. Syncing to Google Calendar is a powerful "execution" feature available only on Pro. Free users can visualize their roadmap within the app.

**Q: What happens if I hit my token limit?**
A: On Pro, you enter the "Economy Lane"—you can still chat, but responses may take a few seconds longer. On Free, chat pauses until your month resets, but you can still view and check off tasks.

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**
A: Yes. If you cancel, your data is preserved, but you'll be downgraded to the Free limits (1 active goal) at the end of your billing cycle.

**Q: Do you offer team plans?**
A: Not yet. dlulu is currently designed for individual achievement.

**Q: Why not unlimited AI?**
A: Real intelligence costs real energy. To sustain a high-quality, ad-free product without selling your data, we set generous but finite fair-use limits.

**Q: Does the Annual plan include more?**
A: Yes! Annual members get 2 months free AND a 50% larger AI token allowance (3M tokens/mo) as a thank-you for your commitment.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Absolutely. Your plans are private. We do not sell your data to third parties or use it to train public models without permission.
