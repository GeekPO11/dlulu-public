# Positioning & Pricing Narrative

> **Status**: Strategic Narrative
> **Purpose**: The "Why" behind the $10 price tag. Internal alignment for marketing copy.

## 1. The One-Liner Positioning
> **"For Dreamers, it's a playground. For Achievers, it's an engine."**

*   **Free (Dreamer)**: "See what's possible." (The Architect)
*   **Pro (Achiever)**: "Make it happen." (The Chief of Staff)

## 2. The Pricing Story

### The "Moment of Value" (Upgrade Trigger)
The user upgrades not when they *generate* a plan, but when they need to *live* it.
*   *Scene*: "I have this amazing AI roadmap (Free). I want it on my Google Calendar so I don't miss it (Pro)."
*   *Scene*: "I finished my first goal. I'm addicted. I want to tackle my health and finance goals now (Pro)."

### Why 1 Goal Free? (The Wedge)
*   We give away the "First Dose" completely.
*   Full AI power on *one* obsession allows the user to trust the system without risk.
*   It filters out "tourists" (who just want to play with AI) from "users" (who want to achieve something).

### The Justification for $10 vs $5
*   **Intelligence Costs Money**: Todoist stores text (cheap). dlulu computes feasibility (expensive Gemini calls).
*   **Value Density**: A "Life Architect" is worth two lattes a month. $5 feels "cheap utility"; $10 feels "premium software".
*   **Comparison**: It's 30% the price of Motion ($34), but smarter than Todoist ($5).

## 3. The "Fair Use" Defense (Objection Handling)

**Q: "Why isn't AI unlimited like ChatGPT?"**
A: "Even ChatGPT has limits (40 msgs/3 hours). We provide a massive bucket (2M tokens) that 99% of users never hit. This ensures one bot-farm doesn't slow down the system for everyone else."

**Q: "Why is Calendar Sync paid?"**
A: "Calendar Sync is expensive to maintain and provides the highest value (automation). It transforms the app from a 'list' to a 'co-pilot'. That's a Pro superpower."

**Q: "What happens if I hit the limit?"**
A: "We don't charge you extra. We just slow down the generation speed slightly until the month resets. You are never locked out of your data."

## 4. Decision Record
*   **Pro Price**: **$10 / month** (Annual $100). confirmed.
    *   *Confidence*: High. Fits squarely between "Manual Tools" ($5) and "Auto-Schedulers" ($30+).
*   **Token Limits**: Free 100k / Pro 2M.
    *   *Confidence*: High. Matches cost model safety margins.
