## 1. Category Framing
We are defining dlulu as: **"The AI Ambition Engine"**.

**Why this frame?**
*   **Not just a "To-Do List"**: If we win "To-Do", we lose to Todoist ($5).
*   **Not just "Project Management"**: If we win "PM", we lose to ClickUp/Linear (Free/Team focus).
*   **Not "Executive Scheduling"**: We aren't just an auto-scheduler like Motion ($34).
*   **The Unique Space**: "Life Architecture" — The bridge between *vague dreams* and *executable tasks*.

## 2. Competitor Rings

### Ring 1: Direct Competitors (AI Goal Planners)
*   **Motion**: Auto-scheduling. High price ($19-$34). Business focus.
*   **Reclaim.ai**: Calendar defense. Good freemium.
*   **Goblin.tools**: Breaking down tasks (Free/Donation). Very simple, no retention.

### Ring 2: Adjacent (Habits & Notes)
*   **Todoist**: The standard for lists. "Karma" gamification. Low price ($4-$6).
*   **Notion**: The "OS" for everything. AI is an add-on ($8-10).
*   **Cron / Notion Calendar**: Free calendar layer.

### Ring 3: Substitutes (The Status Quo)
*   **Google Gemini / ChatGPT**: "Write me a plan." (One-off, no state/tracking).
*   **Spreadsheets**: Infinite flexibility, zero intelligence.
*   **Mental Ops**: "I'll just remember it." (High failure rate).

## 3. Pricing & Packaging Comparison

| Competitor | Free Offering | Pro Price | Paywall Triggers | AI Strategy |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Todoist** | 5 Projects | $5 / mo | +300 Projects, Reminders | AI is a side-feature ("Rewrite task"). |
| **Motion** | 7-day Trial | $34 / mo | Hard Paywall (No Free) | AI is the *only* product. |
| **Notion AI** | Free Workspace | +$10 / mo | Unlimited AI reqs | Add-on to existing workspace. |
| **Reclaim.ai**| 2 Calendars | $8 / mo | Multi-cal sync | AI scheduling is core features. |
| **ChatGPT** | GPT-3.5/4o-mini | $20 / mo | GPT-4o, Usage Caps | The model *is* the value. |
| **dlulu (Draft)**| **1 Goal** | **$10 / mo** | **Unl. Goals, Cal Sync** | **Fair Use limits.** |

**Key Takeaways**:
1.  **Motion ($34)** proves people pay premium for "Auto-Scheduling".
2.  **Todoist ($5)** anchors the "List" value. We must be >$5 because we do "Intelligence", not just "Storage".
3.  **Notion AI ($10)** anchors the "AI Text" value. This validates our $10 price point perfectly.

## 4. Market Packaging Patterns

| Pattern | Verdict for dlulu | Why? |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **"Unlimited Everything"** | **AVOID** | Dangerous with Gemini API costs. |
| **"Credit Packs"** | **AVOID** | High friction. Users hate "counting" every action. |
| **"Fair Use" (Shadow Caps)**| **COPY** | Industry standard for AI wrappers. Keeps UX clean. |
| **"Calendar Sync as Pro"** | **COPY** | The classic B2C productivity retention hook (Reclaim, Calendly). |
| **"Hard Free Limited"** | **COPY** | (e.g., Notion's block limit). 1 Goal limit is our "Block limit". |

---

## 5. What We Should Avoid
1.  **Surprise Bills**: No "Pay-as-you-go" overages. B2C users hate variability.
2.  **The "Tax on Curiosity"**: Don't charge for *generating* plans (the "Aha" moment). Charge for *managing* them over time.
3.  **Complex Tiers**: No "Gold/Platinum/Diamond". Just "Dreamer" (Free) and "Achiever" (Pro).
