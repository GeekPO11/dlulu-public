## Inspiration

Everyone has had a dream that felt too big to start. Not because they were lazy — because they didn't know *where* to start. 

Back in 2007, I saw a surveillance camera and thought: *"What if I put cameras all around a car and a computer helped it navigate?"* I was describing a self-driving car years before anyone called it that. But I was a kid with no roadmap, no system, no way to turn that spark into steps. The idea just… died.

That kept happening. Big ideas, no architecture. And when we looked around, every "productivity tool" on the market was the same: a glorified checklist. They helped you *organize* your dreams, not *engineer* them. Nobody was solving the real problem — breaking down an ambition into something you can actually execute, day by day, step by step.

That's why we built Dlulu. Not for one specific goal — for *every* goal that deserves a real plan.

## What it does

You type your dream into Dlulu — one sentence. Our AI breaks it down into a structured roadmap: phases, milestones, tasks, dependencies, and timelines. Then it becomes your daily command center. An AI coach checks in with you every day. It tracks your progress, predicts your completion timeline, and keeps you honest. Everything lives in one interface — no switching between five different apps. One dream, one plan, one place.

## How we built it

We started with a raw prototype in Google AI Studio — just testing whether AI could actually decompose ambitions into useful plans. Once we validated it could, we chose our stack: React, Supabase, and Gemini. Then we pulled everything local and started vibe coding — the entire platform was built with Antigravity using Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude Opus. The whole project is vibe coded. We thought through every use case, every edge case, monitoring requirements, and tooling. It wasn't just "ship fast" — it was "ship right, fast."

## Challenges we ran into

The UI went through multiple complete redesigns. The interface has to match the seriousness of what people are trying to accomplish — it can't just look like "another app." The prompts were the other beast: we did deep research into goal science — how people actually set, decompose, and achieve goals — and rewrote our AI prompts from scratch based on that research. Getting the AI to produce genuinely useful, specific plans instead of motivational fluff took serious iteration.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We have 11 real users using this platform every single day. **Five of them are doctors preparing for their MD board exams.** That's not a vanity metric — that's doctors trusting our platform with one of the most important exams of their careers. When someone stakes their professional future on something you built, that tells you everything.

## What we learned

Act quickly on feedback. Every user interaction taught us something we couldn't have predicted. And the biggest lesson: **one solution doesn't fit all.** A person learning cricket needs video tutorials for each task. Someone losing weight needs a meal and gym tracker they can update by voice. A student cracking the SAT needs practice analytics. The UI, the tools, and the actions required for every goal are fundamentally different — and the platform has to be fluid enough to adapt to each one.

## What's next for dlulu.life

We're building toward a fully agentic, AI-first platform. The immediate roadmap: calendar sync with Google and Apple Calendars, document management, integrated notes, and a robust adaptive scheduling algorithm that's purely agentic — fluid and responsive to how your life actually works.

The bigger vision: no matter how big your dream is, Dlulu gives you a plan in a fluid UI that *matches your goal*. A chatbot deeply connected to your roadmap, helping you at every step. Anyone can generate a plan in ChatGPT — but execution only happens when plans are presented accurately and tracked accurately. We want to build the platform that everyone uses: from a mother planning how to raise her kids, to a student cracking the SAT, to someone building a startup. This product will be with them day in and day out — a true AI assistant for people who are serious about their ambitions.

**It's a big mission, but the focus is simple: make people successful.**
