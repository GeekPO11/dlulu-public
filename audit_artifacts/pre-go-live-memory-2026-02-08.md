- Theme naming updated to non-copyright identifiers and labels.
- `Original` applied as the brown/orange theme label.
- Add-goal gating hardened for free users across dashboard and goals views.
- Upgrade continuation path wired so successful upgrade can resume blocked add-goal flow.
- Checkout success messaging updated to dedication unlock copy.
- Consolidated migration file created for one-file DB push.
